THIS APP IS BUILT IN ORDER TO LET THE USER 
-VIEW HOUSE LISTINGS ON THE HOMEPAGE
-THE USER CAN ADD A LISTING BY CLICKING ON THE "CREATE A NEW LISTING" LINK. THIS IS A CLIENT SIDE ROUTE THAT WILL DIRECTY THE USER TO THE FORM TO ADD A HOUSE LISTING. ONCE THEY HAVE CLICKEED SUBMIT I USED THE USEHISTORY HOOK FROM REACT TO REDIRECT THE USER BACK TO THE HOMEPAGE TO VIEW THE ADDED LISTING.
-THE THIRD CLIENT SIDE ROUTING FEATURE IS "FAVORITE LISTINGS" WHICH WHEN CLICKED WILL DIRECT THE USER TO VIEW ONLY THE HOUSES THEY HAVE FAVORTED. 
-ANOTHER FEATURE I ADDED WAS A SEARCH BAR WHCIH ALLOWS THE USER TO SEARCH FOR CERTAIN LOCATIONS THEY WISH TO VIEW.
-ALSO I ADDED A SORT BUTTON THAT WILL ALLOW THE USER TO SORT THE HOUSE LISTINGS BY PRICE, FROM LOW TO HIGH


THIS APP WAS CREATED WITH CREATE-REACT-APP
-I CREATED A DB.JSON FILE AND UNDER SCRIPTS I ADDED "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 3004" SO TO VIEW THIS APP YOU JUST HAVE TO WRITE NPM RUN SERVER IN THE TERMINAL
-I ALSO RAN 
NPM INSTALL
NPM INSTALL REACT-ROUTER-DOM IN ORDER TO HANDLE THE CLIENT SIDE ROUTING
NPM INSTALL STYLED-COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO STYLE SOME FEATURES IN THE APP

I THEN CONNECTED IT TO MY GITHUB ACCOUNT BY RUNNING
